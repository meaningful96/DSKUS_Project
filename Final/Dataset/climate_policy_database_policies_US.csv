The initiative is led by the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) within the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).
Leaders of industrial companies are invited to take a corporate-wide voluntary Pledge to reduce the energy intensity of their industrial operations by 25% or more in 10 years. By taking the Pledge, companies are recognized as Better Plants Program Partners and, in partnership with DOE, will work to improve energy management and identify the most cost-effective options for energy and carbon savings.
The U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings, Better Plants Program is an important partnership which consists of close to 160 industrial companies, representing about 2,400 facilities and 11.4% of the total U.S. manufacturing energy footprint as well as several water and wastewater treatment organizations.
In 2011, the Administration launched the Better Buildings initiative to improve the energy use for commercial, industrial, residential, and public buildings by 20% by 2020. The initiative calls on CEOs, university presidents, building owners, state and local government leaders, and residential housing developers to publicly pledge to reduce the energy use of their entire building portfolios.

To United States proposes a shift to low carbon economy and scale up offshore renewable energy. In the electricity sector, United States aims to shift towards carbon-free electricity by 2035, increase energy efficiency, scale up distinct energy sources as hydrogen and invest in carbon capture. In the transport sector the kernel is to switch petrol fuelled vehicles to zero emission ones. Also, raise efficiency standards and investments in both low carbon fuels and alternative transport modals (e.g. rail and biking). In the building sector the focuses are on the enhancement of energy efficiency of electric heating and cooking devices, for instance investing in heat pumps and induction stoves. In the industry sector the government plans to shift fuel burning processes to very low- or zero-carbon processes and to invest in carbon capture. Agriculture and land use are also target by reforestation plans, rotational grazing and forest protection to avoid wildfires.
According to Climate Action Tracker, this target would translate into 1.5-2.5 GtCO2e/yr lower emissions in 2030 below the current policies trajectory. CAT points out that this target includes LULUCF and excluding it would translate to a 43-50% reduction below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

It includes proposed rule listing for new substitutes and prohibiting certain high-GWP HFCs as alternatives under SNAP (4/18/2016) and rules prohibiting certain high-GWP HFCs as alternatives under SNAP. The EPA is driving cost-effective technology adoption through its authority under the Clean Air Act, but the United States should continue to work toward an international phase-down of high-GWP HFC use through the Montreal Protocol (WRI, 2015)
